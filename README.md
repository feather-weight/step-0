> **This application exists to help rightful owners recover access and audit their own wallets—nothing else.**  
> By cloning, building, or using this software, you agree to the following:

## The Vow (You Must Agree)
1. **Recovery-Only.** You will use this software **only** to recover or audit wallets/keys you rightfully own or are explicitly authorized to analyze.
2. **No Misuse.** You will **not** use this project to steal, probe, damage, dismantle, or disrupt any third-party systems or property.
3. **Watch-Only.** Default posture is **watch-only**. No sweeping/broadcasting by default. Any optional sweep tooling must be off, gated, and consent-driven.
4. **Mainnet-Only.** Testnets are disabled for production to avoid confusion. This project prioritizes mainnet scanning for legitimate recovery.
5. **Compliance.** You will follow all applicable laws, contracts, and platform terms. If in doubt, **don’t proceed**.
6. **Transparency & Audit.** You consent to appropriate logging for recovery workflows (with strong protection for sensitive material).
7. **Immediate Stop on Red Flags.** If you suspect misuse or unauthorized access, you will stop, preserve logs, and report as outlined in `SECURITY.md`.

If you cannot agree to all of the above, **do not use this project**.

## What This Repository Is (Step 0)
This is the ethical foundation of the system. It sets standards for:
- **Purpose:** recovery/research for rightful owners.
- **Safety:** watch-only defaults; no custody; no unauthorized access.
- **Compliance:** legal and policy alignment.
- **Conduct:** respectful, safe collaboration.

Technical implementation begins at **Step 1** (in a separate repo). This repo is the mandatory pre-commit gate.

---

## Quick Orientation
- Read **`SECURITY.md`** to understand how to report suspected abuse or security issues.
- Read **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`** for expected behavior in all project spaces.
- Step 1 (engineering setup) proceeds **only after** Step 0 has been acknowledged and committed.

## Acknowledgement
Cloning or contributing constitutes acceptance of **The Vow** above, **SECURITY.md**, and **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**.
